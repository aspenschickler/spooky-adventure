L[A]: Awooooooo! Back off, you oversized dog! This is OUR ring now!
L[A]: I said back off! We’re not scared of you!
R[Werewolf]: *GROWL*
L[A]: Looks like you’re not scared of us either...
N[Narrator]: The werewolf comes closer and closer, cornering you all against the walls of the cave.
N[Narrator]: It swings at [C], and as they jump back they drop the ring on the ground.
N[Narrator]: It clinks against the ground, and for a brief moment the werewolf is distracted in its rage. There’s your chance!
N[Narrator]: You leap towards the ring and slip it onto your finger. In an instant, sparks arise at your fingertips.
N[Narrator]: Right as the werewolf prepares to attack again, you raise your hand high in the air towards it.
N[Narrator]: Your whole body tingles and glows with energy, and suddenly you fire a massive red bolt of electricity.
N[Narrator]: There is a huge flash which makes the entire cave light up.
N[Narrator]: The next thing you see is the werewolf on the floor, paralyzed.
