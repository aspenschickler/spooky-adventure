R[B]: We already are! Which way do we go?
L[A]: Left! No, no, right! Urgh, why does it have to be so dark around here?

N[Narrator]: He’s following you about thirty feet back.
N[Narrator]: He gets down on all fours and breaks into a sprint.
N[Narrator]: He’s gaining on you!
L[A]: Don’t worry! We’ll be fine as long as we don’t reach a-
R[B]: Dead end.
N[Narrator]: The werewolf comes closer and closer, cornering you all against the walls of the cave.

N[Narrator]: You leap towards the ring and slip it onto your finger. In an instant, sparks arise at your fingertips.
N[Narrator]: Right as the werewolf prepares to attack again, you raise your hand high in the air towards it.

N[Narrator]: There is a huge flash which makes the entire cave light up.
N[Narrator]: The next thing you see is the werewolf on the floor, paralyzed.
