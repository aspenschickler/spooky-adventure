L[A]: You asked for it!
N[Narrator]: You raise your hand and charge up your magic ring, which begins to glow a bright red.
N[Narrator]: [D] starts to chant a spell of their own. Finally, you both attack.
L[A]: Take this!
R[D]: Begone!
N[Narrator]: As much as you try, [D]'s magic is simply stronger than yours.
N[Narrator]: The blasts connect, but their beam is pushing closer and close towards you. Is all hope lost?
N[Narrator]: No. Suddenly, you get an idea.
L[A]: The columns! If I can force [D] to knock one down, then maybe...
R[D]: What are you mumbling about!
L[A]: Nothing much - just this!
N[Narrator]: You jump to the side and [D]'s magic beam hits the base of a column.
N[Narrator]: It tilts, crackles, and finally topples down on top of them.
R[D]: AAAH!
