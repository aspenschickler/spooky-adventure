N[Voice]: Come in!
R[B]: If you’re trying to scare us, the house gave it away already. You come out here!

R[B]: Sure...
N[Voice]: If you want your candy, just come in and take as much as you want. I bought all the best ones, too. They’re to die for.
R[B]: No scares?
N[Voice]: No scares.

N[Narrator]: [B] Reaches for the doorknob, and as soon as they touch it, the house begins to shake.

N[Narrator]: In just a moment, [B] gets sucked in!
